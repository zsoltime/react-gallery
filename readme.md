# React Image Gallery

React image gallery. The app fetches a JSON file from [DataBro](http://databro.com)
with a list of images and display them in a grid. Clicking on any of them opens
the image in a lightbox. Instead of showing the images in a modal window, the
app replaces the grid in the DOM with the lightbox.
